# JavaScript Practice Tasks

This repository contains a collection of small JavaScript tasks and logic problems I’ve solved to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals. Each task is implemented in a clean and readable way for easy learning and future reference.

## 📁 Structure

Each task is saved as a separate file with meaningful names, such as:

- `find_duplicate_emails.js`
- `top_N_products.js`
- `nested_obj_path.js`

You can run any file using Node.js or copy the logic into the browser console for quick testing.


🛠️ How to Run

Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-tasks.git
cd javascript-tasks
Run any task file using Node:
`node square-number.js`

💡 Goals

Practice core JavaScript logic
Build a reference collection of common coding tasks
Improve problem-solving skills
